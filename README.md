# What I have learned so far

* Angular basis - I have gone through Angular tutorial in https://angular.io/ and done exercise introduced there(Tour of Heroes app). Now I can write small and simple Angular application.

* I have created a demo store using Spartacus schematics and know how to debug Spartacus-core.js and find its counterpart implementation source code in https://github.com/SAP/spartacus.

* I have finished learning basic Spartacus training videos ( 3 hours ) and advanced Spartacus training( day 1 and day 2 part).

* Now I have gained basic knowledge on Spartacus, regarding its advantage compared with old accelerators, outlets, CMS components, config typing, routing and styling. I use my own learning best practice to study these topics: first watch video, then do exercise and debug related Spartacus source code to understand what happened under the hood .

# What I plan to learn for the next days

## finish the left part: 

* Spartacus layout design

* internationalization

* Dependency injection and rxJS ( I already learned both a little bit through https://angular.io/) 

* data binding

# I think I'm ready to take a small bug soon, to verify my learning progress!
